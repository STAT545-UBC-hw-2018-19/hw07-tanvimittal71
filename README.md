This repository is my submission for HW07 for STAT547M.

In this assignment, I added functions to already existing [Power package](https://github.com/vincenzocoia/powers)

I have added below mentioned two functions to compute:
* [Box-Cox Transformation](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-tanvimittal71/blob/master/powers-master/R/boxcox.R)
* [Cube-root](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-tanvimittal71/blob/master/powers-master/R/cbrt.R)

Documents:
* [ReadMe](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-tanvimittal71/blob/master/powers-master/README.md): for higher-level description and details to download the package
* [Vignette](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-tanvimittal71/tree/master/powers-master/vignettes): for extensive examples on how to use functions in package(Render the Rmd file for user-friendly view)

[Test cases](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-tanvimittal71/tree/master/powers-master/tests) run and [Check](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-tanvimittal71/tree/master/powers.Rcheck) files also included
